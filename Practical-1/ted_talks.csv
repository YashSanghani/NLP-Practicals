For instance, I consider myself a good reader, I can write, but my brain does not allow me to understand the content of texts (even written by myself), I have almost no short term memory or processing memory. This makes it very hard to learn anything via normal education. But somehow by creating all kinds of tools for myself, I managed to get a degree on university level.
I could imagine that people who had a stroke could have the same problem. In that case 'work hard and then you learn something because the chemical changes in your brain' doesn't really apply. The focus should be on giving people  tools to be able to process the information properly before they start learning anything.","

Three levels of changes in neuroplasticity for learning:
* chemical changes for short-term memory,
* structure changes for long-term memory,
* functional changes for shifting brain areas.

The most interesting ideas are that: 
* our brain will be shaped structurally and functionally by our behavior!
* difficulty during practicing lead to more changes in the brain (more efficient?)

Everyone is his own designer for his brain and be aware of our daily habit!

Hope you learn new skills more effictively.","

163,"I agree that everyone learns in a different way. For instance, I consider myself a good reader, I can write, but my brain does not allow me to understand the content of texts (even written by myself), I have almost no short term memory or processing memory. This makes it very hard to learn anything via normal education. But somehow by creating all kinds of tools for myself, I managed to get a degree on university level.
I could imagine that people who had a stroke could have the same problem. In that case 'work hard and then you learn something because the chemical changes in your brain' doesn't really apply. The focus should be on giving people  tools to be able to process the information properly before they start learning anything.","

Three levels of changes in neuroplasticity for learning:
* chemical changes for short-term memory,
* structure changes for long-term memory,
* functional changes for shifting brain areas.

The most interesting ideas are that: 
* our brain will be shaped structurally and functionally by our behavior!
* difficulty during practicing lead to more changes in the brain (more efficient?)

Everyone is his own designer for his brain and be aware of our daily habit!

Hope you learn new skills more effictively.","

243,"I agree that everyone learns in a different way. For instance, I consider myself a good reader, I can write, but my brain does not allow me to understand the content of texts (even written by myself), I have almost no short term memory or processing memory. This makes it very hard to learn anything via normal education. But somehow by creating all kinds of tools for myself, I managed to get a degree on university level.
I could imagine that people who had a stroke could have the same problem. In that case 'work hard and then you learn something because the chemical changes in your brain' doesn't really apply. The focus should be on giving people  tools to be able to process the information properly before they start learning anything.","

Three levels of changes in neuroplasticity for learning:
* chemical changes for short-term memory,
* structure changes for long-term memory,
* functional changes for shifting brain areas.

The most interesting ideas are that: 
* our brain will be shaped structurally and functionally by our behavior!
* difficulty during practicing lead to more changes in the brain (more efficient?)

Everyone is his own designer for his brain and be aware of our daily habit!

Hope you learn new skills more effictively.","

For instance, I consider myself a good reader, I can write, but my brain does not allow me to understand the content of texts (even written by myself), I have almost no short term memory or processing memory. This makes it very hard to learn anything via normal education. But somehow by creating all kinds of tools for myself, I managed to get a degree on university level.
I could imagine that people who had a stroke could have the same problem. In that case 'work hard and then you learn something because the chemical changes in your brain' doesn't really apply. The focus should be on giving people  tools to be able to process the information properly before they start learning anything.","

Three levels of changes in neuroplasticity for learning:
* chemical changes for short-term memory,
* structure changes for long-term memory,
* functional changes for shifting brain areas.

The most interesting ideas are that: 
* our brain will be shaped structurally and functionally by our behavior!
* difficulty during practicing lead to more changes in the brain (more efficient?)

Everyone is his own designer for his brain and be aware of our daily habit!

Hope you learn new skills more effictively.","

This makes it very hard to learn anything via normal education. But somehow by creating all kinds of tools for myself, I managed to get a degree on university level.
I could imagine that people who had a stroke could have the same problem. In that case 'work hard and then you learn something because the chemical changes in your brain' doesn't really apply. The focus should be on giving people  tools to be able to process the information properly before they start learning anything.","

Three levels of changes in neuroplasticity for learning:
* chemical changes for short-term memory,
* structure changes for long-term memory,
* functional changes for shifting brain areas.

The most interesting ideas are that: 
* our brain will be shaped structurally and functionally by our behavior!
* difficulty during practicing lead to more changes in the brain (more efficient?)

Everyone is his own designer for his brain and be aware of our daily habit!

Hope you learn new skills more effictively.","

Neuroplasticity is supported by chemical, structural and functional changes.
The primary driver for neuroplastic change in the brain is behavior. Nothing is more effective for changing the brain than practice.
Patterns of neuroplasticity can vary dramatically from person to person.
Neuroplastic change can be positive or negative. The brain is shaped by what we do and what we don't do.","

I could imagine that people who had a stroke could have the same problem. In that case 'work hard and then you learn something because the chemical changes in your brain' doesn't really apply. The focus should be on giving people  tools to be able to process the information properly before they start learning anything.","

Three levels of changes in neuroplasticity for learning:
* chemical changes for short-term memory,
* structure changes for long-term memory,
* functional changes for shifting brain areas.

The most interesting ideas are that: 
* our brain will be shaped structurally and functionally by our behavior!
* difficulty during practicing lead to more changes in the brain (more efficient?)

Everyone is his own designer for his brain and be aware of our daily habit!

Hope you learn new skills more effictively.","

Neuroplastic change can be positive or negative. The brain is shaped by what we do and what we don't do.","

This makes it very hard to learn anything via normal education. But somehow by creating all kinds of tools for myself, I managed to get a degree on university level.
I could imagine that people who had a stroke could have the same problem. In that case 'work hard and then you learn something because the chemical changes in your brain' doesn't really apply. The focus should be on giving people  tools to be able to process the information properly before they start learning anything.","

Three levels of changes in neuroplasticity for learning:
* chemical changes for short-term memory,
* structure changes for long-term memory,
* functional changes for shifting brain areas.

The most interesting ideas are that: 
* our brain will be shaped structurally and functionally by our behavior!
* difficulty during practicing lead to more changes in the brain (more efficient?)

Everyone is his own designer for his brain and be aware of our daily habit!

Hope you learn new skills more effictively.","

Neuroplasticity is supported by chemical, structural and functional changes.
The primary driver for neuroplastic change in the brain is behavior. Nothing is more effective for changing the brain than practice.
Patterns of neuroplasticity can vary dramatically from person to person.
Neuroplastic change can be positive or negative. The brain is shaped by what we do and what we don't do.","
